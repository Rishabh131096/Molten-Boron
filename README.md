This project uses the web camera to detect faces and recognizes the faces in each frame.

There is a directory(Training-data) which has sub-directories that store the images that will be used for training the face_recognizer.
Thus for every frame of the video captured by the webcam, we can recognize the faces of all the people that we know.
